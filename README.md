# Defcon-Shoot-31-Badge
The badge is a 3d printed ar-15 trigger crank. I tweaked the fosscad design a little to make the pusher captive, redesigned the pusher, lenthened the paddle, and adjusted the holes on the side clam-shells.  
The lanyard text is from mrchaddavis on twitter and his optimized scad code: https://twitter.com/mrchaddavis/status/1605466507508649984

Tips:

1. The bolts/screws are printed at 96% scale for X and Y so I didn't modify the original stl. But I heard there are some special "thread" printing options on some slicers so you may not need to do this. You may need to dial this in based on your esteps
2. I scaled up the crank's stl and printed at 100%, This was to avoid first-layer squish on the paddles preventing me from inserting them easily. Though they can probably be scalled back down a few percent
3. The paddles were scalled at 123% X (which made the long flat portion thicker, not longer). When I was dealing with such a small part I was trying to optimize the exact number of passes printed to get the most full-size passes of plastic down
4. After printing the slot mouth for the pusher may not line up perfectly on each of the side clam-shells. I often took a razor blade to slightly widen the mouth of this slot so the pusher would fall in and out freely. Otherwise the trigger's return spring may not have enough force to push the pusher back into the crank body so the trigger will never reset. You want to be able to shake the crank and have the pusher freely move in and out.
5. You can also shave down the high points on each side of the pusher. Especially if you get a lot of first-layer squish on one side you should bevel that off.
6. I was originally planning on glue/epoxy to connect the paddle to the crank. However this was hard to align and would break off easily. After they were all printed I decided to drill a hole in the crank and paddle to put a screw through them to hold them together. If you're printing a bunch for the first time I'd adust the stl's to have a hole in these parts. However the two failures I saw were at the paddle so maybe this part should be beefed up in some way (only one flat cut out? A smaller notch instead of flats?)
8. The lanyard used a cellphone loop attachment that was around the bolt threads, which I screwed in to keep it attached.
9. I printed these with petg due to UV concerns and it seemed like the better option for this kind of print

Parts:

Long screws to hold the body together (4x per badge): Phillips Pan Head 304 Stainless Steel A2 Machine Screws M2.5 30mm length  
Nuts (4x per badge): uxcell Hex Nuts, M2.5x0.45mm Metric Coarse Thread  
Screw to hold crank to paddle (1x per badge): Black Self Tapping Screws Phillip Pan Head M2 20mm  
Washers for all screws (on the pan head side 5x per badge)  
I included a phillips bit, but it probably wasn't necessary.
